# Lab01: Toolbox Functions

Let's practice using some tool box functions! You may work with a partner for this one.

# Setup 

Create a [Shadertoy account](https://www.shadertoy.com/). Either fork this shadertoy, or create a new shadertoy and copy the code from the [Flower Puzzle](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/NsVBzy).

# Puzzles

Do your best to replicate the following simple graphics:

1. Pulsing Flower

2. Spinning Flower

3. Modify the base code to create a new flower!
- Ideas: add additional shapes, create an interior for the flower, change the animation, make your flower explode, add an animated background, use color gradients.

# Submission
- Create a pull request to this repository
- In the README, include the names of both your team members
- In the README, create a link to your shader toy solutions for these three prompts
- Make sure all three of your shadertoys are set to UNLISTED or PUBLIC (so we can see them!)

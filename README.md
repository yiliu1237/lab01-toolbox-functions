# Our Shaders!

1. Pulsing Flower

Red version: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/lXlyDn 

We created this using a sine wave where the amplitude changed based on time. 

2. Spinning Flower

Red version: https://www.shadertoy.com/view/MXscDr

We created this using a triangle wave, and we caused it to rotate by multiplying it by the sine of time. 

3. Sparkles!

We created this using two overlapping sine waves and multiplied another sine wave to them. We also changed the colors to make it more magical.
